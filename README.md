# AI-Powered Blood Group Detection System

An advanced computer vision and machine learning system for automated blood group detection from sample images.

## Overview

This application analyzes blood sample images to determine blood types (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-) by detecting agglutination patterns in antibody tests.

Key features:
- Accurate detection of blood groups from blood sample images
- Analysis of Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-D, and H Antigen test results
- Machine learning models for agglutination detection
- User-friendly web interface for uploading and analyzing samples
- Comprehensive result reporting with confidence levels
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple samples

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image
- NumPy
- Flask
- Matplotlib
- Joblib
